# HPS
Project Idea:
Creating a long-term advertising campaign to introduce HPS, an Egyptian company that sells electrical devices specialized in milk analysis. These devices clarify data related to milk (Fat - Acidity - Density - Added Water - Protein - Freezing Point), and also detect tampering. They save the time and effort spent using traditional methods like the Gerber method and test tubes. The company also provides maintenance services for all devices.

Company Vision:
To expand in the Egyptian market by providing a good product at a suitable price, achieving a large market share, and offering competitive pricing for maintenance and repair services to customers. The location chosen is Cairo, to serve clients in Cairo and surrounding governorates.
